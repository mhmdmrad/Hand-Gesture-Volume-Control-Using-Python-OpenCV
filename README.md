## Hand-Gesture-Volume-Control-Using-Python-OpenCV
This project enables gesture based volume control using a webcam and thumb movements. When the user shows a thumbs-up, the volume increases, and when showing a thumbs-down, the volume decreases. This hands-free approach is achieved using computer vision and machine learning.
